(* Memo 

    A memo brick is a brick that is wrapped around another brick and remembers the previous value of it.

    The value of a memo brick is (previousValue, currentValue)

    tbd: kill memo, memo is unstable, because it does not support multiple consumers.

(*
    A diff brick is a memo brick and a diff function that is applied to output values of the memo.

    tbd: terminology is confusing: we need another name for diffs over time.
    tbd: diff is basically stable, because memo does not have more than one consumer
